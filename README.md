## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h1>Natures friend: Your Farming partner</h1>

  <h2>Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Solution</h2>
  <p>Nature friend is a friendly, AI-powered mobile app designed to help small farmers in India make smarter farming choices. Built with Flutter, it works on any smartphone, delivering a smooth experience. The backend runs on Node.js, connecting to weather and market APIs for real-time data. AI models, powered by TensorFlow, suggest crops and detect pests, while Google Cloud’s voice tech lets you talk to the app in languages like Hindi or Tamil. It stores data locally with SQLite for offline use and in MongoDB for cloud access, ensuring farmers get advice anytime, anywhere.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Guidance Support</b>: Using your soil type, weather, and crop history, it recommends the best crops and fertilizers, potentially boosting yields by 20–30% and saving ₹2,000–5,000 per season.</li>
    <li><b>Easy to Use</b>: Voice commands in your native language and offline mode make it accessible, even if you can’t read or lack internet.</li>
    <li><b>Pest Protection</b>: Snap a plant photo, and AI identifies diseases or pests, suggesting quick fixes to save your crops.</li>
    <li><b>Better Profits</b>: Market price updates help you sell smartly, cutting reliance on untrustworthy middlemen.</li>
    <li><b>Eco-Friendly</b>: Advice on balanced fertilizer use protects soil and reduces chemical waste, supporting sustainable farming.</li>
  </ul>  
  <h2>Innovation and Uniqueness of the Solution</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>All in one Tool</b>: Combines crop advice, pest detection, and market updates in one app, unlike apps that do just one thing.</li>
    <li><b>Language</b>: Voice support in regional languages makes it welcoming for everyone, especially non-readers.</li>
    <li><b>Works Offline</b>: Local storage and SMS alerts keep it functional in areas with shaky internet.</li>
    <li><b>Smarter Over Time</b>: Your feedback helps improve the app, and partnerships with ICAR or NGOs ensure reliable data.</li>
    <li><b>Affordable and Scalable</b>: Built with free tools like Flutter and RASA, it’s cost-effective and can grow to support millions with help from government or startup collaborations.</li>
  </ul>

## Technical Approach
<h2>Technologies to be used on this AI app</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong>The Frontend will be used in flutter as it supports both Android and iOS platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Backend:</strong>The Backend will be done using Node.js,Express.js and also Integrated with various Api and server side logic.</li>
    <li><strong>AI/ML:</strong>As farmers may confuse with crop recommendation, for this TensorFlow/Keras models and pest/disease detection via convolutional neural networks (CNNs).</li>
    <li><strong>Database:</strong>The Database will be managed using MongoDB for storing user profiles, crop data, and feedback; SQLite for offline storage on the app.</li>
    <li><strong>NLP for Voice Processing:</strong>Natural language processing (NLP) will be utilized for voice commands and queries,and with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs for voice interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>APIs:</strong>AgriStack for weather data and OpenweatherMap and local mandi APIs for market prices</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud:</strong>Google Cloud or AWS for hosting model deployment</li>
    <li><strong>Hardware:</strong>The solution is based on Smartphone and leveraging existing devices (no additional hardware required)</li>
    <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong>OpenCV for preprocessing images before feeding them into CNN models for pest/disease detection.</li>
</ul>

## Feasibility and Viability

<ul><h3>Feasibility analyse for the idea</h3>
    <li>Flutter for a user-friendly mobile app, Node.js and MongoDB for a scalable backend, and TensorFlow for AI-driven crop and pest recommendations</li>
    <li>Google Cloud makes Speech-to-Text supports voice features in regional languages like Hindi and Tamil, while SQLite enables offline access for rural areas.</li>
    <li>Development costs are low due to open-source tools like Flutter and RASA making the app low cost friendly for developers.</li>
    <li>Farmers save money through optimized inputs—studies suggest 20 to 30% yield increases, potentially saving ₹2,000 to 5,000 per season on fertilizers and pesticides. Maintenance costs are a concern but can be offset by grants or startup collaborations.</li>
    <li>The app's simple interface, voice support, and offline mode make it easily accessible for low-literate farmers.</li>
    <li>The cloud-based backend supports millions of users, and the modular design allows adding features like market linkages or new languages.</li>
    <li>Feedback collection from customers ensures continuous improvement, though initial training may be needed for older users.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Potential challenges and risks</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Availability:</strong> Incomplete or inconsistent localized data may lead to less accurate recommendations, frustrating farmers.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital Literacy:</strong> Older or less tech-savvy farmers may hesitate to adopt the app, preferring traditional methods.</li>
    <li><strong>Internet Connectivity:</strong> Limited network coverage in rural areas could hinder access to realtime features like weather alerts.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustained Funding:</strong> Costs for server maintenance, model retraining, and updates could strain resources without external support.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strategies for overcoming these challenges</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Availability:</strong> Collaborate with ICAR, NABARD, and state agriculture departments to access and standardize datasets. Encourage farmers to contribute data via the app to build a richer database over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital Literacy:</strong> Partner with NGOs and extension officers to conduct workshops, demonstrating tangible benefits like cost savings (e.g., ₹2,000 saved on pesticides). Leverage local cooperatives as app ambassadors to build trust.</li>
    <li><strong>Internet Connectivity:</strong> Prioritize offline features, such as pre-downloaded crop guides and pest detection models. Use SMS for critical alerts like weather warnings to bypass internet dependency.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustained Funding:</strong>Secure funding from government schemes (e.g., Digital India) or CSR initiatives. Explore partnerships with agri-tech startups to share maintenance costs, ensuring long-term viability.</li>
</ul>
